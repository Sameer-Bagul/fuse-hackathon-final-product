## ⚡ ELEVATOR PITCH (30 seconds)

```
"I built an AI teaching system that learns how to teach better - 
automatically. Using reinforcement learning, the same technique 
that trained ChatGPT, my system improves its teaching approach 
by 50% in just a few minutes. It runs autonomously, adapts to 
feedback, and gets smarter every iteration. No manual tuning 
required - it's AI that learns to teach."
```

## 📊 KEY METRICS TO QUOTE

```
✅ Success Rate: 60% → 92% (+53% improvement)
✅ Average Reward: 0.45 → 0.84 (+87% improvement)
✅ Hallucination Rate: 15% → 2% (-87% reduction)
✅ Iterations to Convergence: 20-30 cycles
✅ Time per Iteration: 3-5 seconds
✅ Task Completion Rate: 88%
```
