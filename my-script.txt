Hey everyone! Iâ€™m Sameer, a developer passionate about building and creating innovative solutions. Just recently me and my team went for a Hackathon at SKNCOE Pune and we came across a really amazing Problem statement and we build something really cool around it.
The problem statement was to an AI model that can learn to from the Reinforcement Learning feedback loop with the meta learning capabilities.
So we build an AI model that can learn to teach other AI models.
We named it "Learno" - An AI that learns to teach.
