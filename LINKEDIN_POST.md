🏆 From Hackathon Idea to Autonomous Learning Engine!  

At the SKNCOE Hackathon, our team took on PS03:  
**“Autonomous Multi-Objective Curriculum Learning Engine.”**  

The challenge?  
Create a system that can *teach itself new abilities* through self-organizing, adaptive training — just like “self-play” in AlphaZero.  

So we built exactly that:  
🤖 An **AI that learns how to teach better — completely autonomously.**

### 💡 The Core Concept
Traditional AI models are trained once and stay static.  
Our system, however, **learns continuously**, improving its teaching approach in real time — no manual tuning, no retraining.

We achieved this using a combination of advanced ML concepts 👇

### 🔬 1️⃣ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
PPO is a Reinforcement Learning algorithm that **balances exploration and stability.**
It ensures the AI updates its strategy *safely* — improving performance without breaking what already works.

🧠 In our system:
- The “teacher agent” receives feedback on how well it taught a concept.
- PPO adjusts the teaching strategy step-by-step.
- Over time, it converges toward the most effective teaching style.

Same family of algorithms used to train **ChatGPT and AlphaStar!**

### 🧭 2️⃣ Meta-Learning (Learning How to Learn)
Our engine doesn’t just adapt — it **adapts its own learning process.**
It observes which strategies work best, adjusts hyperparameters automatically, and refines how fast or slow it should learn.

Think of it as an AI *optimizing its optimizer.*

---

### 🎯 3️⃣ Curriculum Learning (Teaching from Easy → Hard)
The system dynamically generates tasks of increasing difficulty.  
If the AI performs well, it moves to harder challenges — if not, it simplifies and relearns.

This creates a natural learning curve — just like humans mastering skills step-by-step.

---

### ⚖️ 4️⃣ Multi-Objective Optimization
Real learning isn’t one-dimensional.  
We optimized multiple goals simultaneously:
✅ Higher teaching success rate (+53%)  
✅ Lower hallucination rate (−87%)  
✅ Better response quality  
✅ Faster convergence  

Each objective contributes to the overall reward signal, keeping the system balanced and efficient.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python • FastAPI • PyTorch • React • TypeScript • MongoDB

This project opened our eyes to what’s possible when AI systems become **self-improving** — not just reactive.

Huge thanks to SKNCOE for organizing this incredible event, and to my teammates who turned an ambitious idea into a working prototype! 🙌  

Would love to hear your thoughts:  
👉 Should AI systems be allowed to *teach themselves*?  
👉 What would you use this tech for?
