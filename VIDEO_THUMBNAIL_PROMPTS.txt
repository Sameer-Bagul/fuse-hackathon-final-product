Create a bold, modern thumbnail with a large bold headline text: 'AI THAT LEARNS TO TEACH' in white, heavy sans-serif, with a neon blue glow. On the left side, show an advanced AI robot or abstract neural network visualization. On the right side, behind the headline, show an upward green line graph (success rate) with bright points and a subtle glow. Include a small circular icon of a robot/brain above the graph. Color palette: dark gradient background (navy #0b1226 to deep purple #2c1a6e), neon blue #3B82F6 accents, success green #10B981 highlights, white text. Lighting: dramatic with highlights on key elements. Composition: AI visual occupies left third, headline and graph occupy right two-thirds, clear safe area for text. Add subtle lens flare and vignette. Aspect ratio 16:9, resolution 1280x720. Negative prompt: text gibberish, low-res, watermarks, text-heavy clutter, oversaturated colors. Style: modern tech startup, high contrast, energetic.
